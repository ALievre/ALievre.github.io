<p style="text-indent: 2%; text-align: justify;">
    As we saw during the Communication module, more and more connected objects and systems are appearing every day. With them comes a huge amount of data. In this module, we worked on exploiting and adding value to these data.

        This module is composed of three courses. In Big Data and Semantic Data, we studied different way to handle data. The Software Engineering class was more about general skills necessary for software engineering like the Agile method or Continuous Integration. I summarized the classes in the table below. The next subsection will focus on one experience: the data analysis project made using Python and sklearn.

In the lecture, we go over the main development phases and project management method in software engineering. This class is then linked to the Service Oriented Architecture Project, as we used the Agile method in it, following the concepts learned in this class.</td>

        <p style="text-indent: 10%; margin-left: 10%; text-align: justify;">
            In this class, we learned how to process data and we saw different clustering methods. We could choose some data sets from a wide choice of data sets to study the different clustering methods. We studied the K-Means, Agglomerative and DBSCAN methods. After establishing the benefits and drawbacks of each methods, we used them to study unknown data sets. Finally, we had to do a full study of a real meteorological data.

        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            Since it was the first time I had a Semantic Data class, the challenge was to grasp the meaning of the different notions like Ontology, Data Property or Object Property. The first lab really helped with that. The second lab used the ontology we created with a Java application. The main challenge of this lab was to understand how to create an Instance and how to manipulate them in Java. My knowledge in this programming language helped me to implement the different functions I needed for this application.

            This class involved theoretical notions about data processing. During the lab sessions, we utilized these notions to analyze a real set of data. The challenges of these labs were to understand the sklearn package and the pandas package used to implement all the clustering methods. The working principle of the different metrics used to evaluate the methods was not as easy as I thought to understand. Thankfully, the documentation provided by scikit-learn website really helped me to fully comprehend all those notions.

        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            This class gave us an insight of software development and project management methods. After learning it during theoretical courses, we had to implement these methods to our projects. The main method we had to apply was the Agile method. I already had a class in 4th year called Project Management which addressed this method, so I was already familiar with it. The challenge was to use a tool, the Jira software, to implement the Agile method in our projects. We used it during our Service Oriented Architecture project. It took us some time to get acquainted with this tool. In the end, it was useful to us in order to respect the planning of our project.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            Another challenge was to implement a Continuous Integration for our SOA project. It was difficult to use Jenkins since we did not have a server to host it. So, we ended up using GitHub Actions but since we did not see it during the classes, it was a bit difficult to implement.

        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            This module contained really different types of skills. The majority of those skills were new to me but I managed to acquired them thanks to these courses.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            For the Semantic Data class, I think I met the requirements by doing the labs which were really useful to me to fully comprehend the notions.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            For the Big Data class, I was really invested in learning how to cluster the data even though I never did it before. I learned a lot of skills during these labs.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            For the Software Engineering class, I already knew the Agile method but learning to use a tool to help implement it is a good skill to have. It was also interesting to acquire a new method of software development, i.e., continuous integration. I think that I met the requirements but that I did not have time to go further.

        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            This module was very interesting. The Semantic Data class was short but precise. I think I learned a lot of interesting notions that I did not know before. I think that it would be stimulating to integrate these notions in a project. I enjoyed the class and I wish I had more labs on the subject.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            Next, I was wondering why the Software Engineering class was a part of this module and not in the Middleware and Service one since it was linked to the Service Oriented Architecture project. However, I did not like that we were forced to apply the Agile method to the SOA project. In fact, the project was done in groups of two or three students, which is not really relevant to the use of this method. It probably would have been better to use it to our Innovative project since it was a 4-month long project in teams of at least 5 students.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            Finally, the Big Data class was really compelling. It felt amusing to try to analyze data and see the correlations in the analysis of the real data. I liked how the labs were created in a logical order (discovering the methods, using them, analyzing a real data set). It was a refreshing class since I did not have any before.
