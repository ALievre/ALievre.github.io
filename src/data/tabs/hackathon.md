SUPERVIZOR: THIERRY MONTEIL

<p style="text-indent: 2%; text-align: justify;">
    Every year, the ISS students must participate in a Hackathon. This year, Mr. Monteil chose the International oneM2M Hackathon managed by the Korean Electronic Technology Institute (KETI) and the European Telecommunication Standards Institute (ETSI).

       This Hackathon had international participants from Korea, India, Spain, Germany, USA, and France. It lasted one month from the 30th of September to the 4th of November. The deliverables were a huckster.io project describing the IoT solution we produced and a short demo video. The subject of this event was to build and IoT solution helping citizens with social or environmental issues using the oneM2M standard. Thus, it was a project with a close link to the Middleware & Service module.

        With a team of 4 students (2 from AE, 1 from GP and 1 from IR), we decided to create a Smart Crop Monitoring and Growth Management to reduce water consumption. As agriculture represents nearly 70% of the world’s water consumption, a lot of systems have been developed to optimize the watering method. However, plant growth is almost never considered.  Moreover, we noticed a significant lack of databases informing us about the parameters influencing the plant growth parameters. It is in this context that we wanted to develop an intelligent monitoring system to fill the gaps identified. The main functionalities of our system are the following:
    </p>
    <ul style="text-align: justify;">
        <li>Monitor the growth of the plant, water consumption and external parameters (luminosity, temperature, soil humidity, …).</li>
        <br>
        <li>Remotely control the watering or define some strategic rules to automate plant watering.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Predict the amount of water to deliver to the plant to achieve a certain growth rate over a given period for a given plant.</li>
    </ul>

        During this Hackathon, we encountered many challenges:
    </p>
    <ul style="text-align: justify;">
        <li>-	The sensors. As a matter of fact, we used several analogic sensors. Thus, we needed to use a multiplexer since the ESP8266 only has one analogic pin. It took us some time to operate it and we even had to change it. Finally, we succeeded thanks to the help of online documentation.</li>
        <br>
        <li>-	The valve. First, we had issues finding one, but we managed to get it one week before the deadline. Then, it was not working with our system and we had to buy hoses to guide the water flow into the valve. Moreover, to have enough pressure to use the valve, we used a cat water fountain motor. In the end, everything was working but it took us some time to understand what was missing and then to collect all the material.</li>
    </ul>

            I may be biased do to the fact of winning it, but I feel like tha Hackaton was a really great experience for me and all the other students. We were put in a fair competing environment where there was only good spirit and help between the different team. I was lucky to have a team that was very invested in the event and was willing to finish at 11 PM on the 5th.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            A rush event like this one brings up a lot of key engineer skills in my opinion. You have to be able to explain your ideas quickly and clearly to your team, listen to everyone input and try to assign tasks in the more efficient way. Managing different skillsets on a limited time window can be tough, but I think we did a pretty good job with it. Working long hours can also be a source of conflict between team members, and it is important to avoid or manage that.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            On a more technical standpoint, even though we contemplated getting out of our comfort zone and trying to work on different fields than our field of expertize, we realized that with so little time, we had to focus on what we were good at. I would say this was a good test to see how to work under stress and time constraint without getting overwhelmed by it. I used technical points seen in the classes of ISS, like RESt requests in Python, Arduino data interfacing, etc ...
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">   
            In the end, it was a real pleasure to take part in the Hackaton, me and my teammates tried to produce the best thing we could, and we are really happy that it paid of and lead to a victory in the end.
