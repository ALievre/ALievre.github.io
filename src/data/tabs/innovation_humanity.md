    We all know that being an engineer relies a lot on technical skills but cannot forget the human aspects of this position. This module keeps us aware of all the subjects related to this facet of engineering.

        This module gathers six classes that focus on human skills. We had a Team Management class that gave us the perspective of a team manager. We also studied Creativity, Innovation and Social Psychology. In addition, we had the continuation of the Individualized Professional Development course with a mockup job interview. Finally, we cannot forget the Sport part. The variety of the classes makes so that some of the skills learned are directly linked to managing a project as an engineer, but other apply to humans in general and how to live as a citizen in our society. You can find a quick summary of the courses in the table below. The next subsection will focus on the most relevant experiences in more detail.

        <summary style="color: #9c56c2">Social psychology, intercultural relationships</summary>
        <p style="text-indent: 10%; margin-left: 10%; text-align: justify;">
            This class was one of the most original one. The professor used a different teaching method. We debated a lot on different subjects, and we learned the core concepts through presentations by the students. We also spent an entire 3-hour class watching the movie Twelve Angry Men, and then analyzing it. It is about a jury of men discussing if they should vote guilty or not guilty during a trial. This movie represents almost all the themes of social psychology like manipulation, social influence or even prejudice.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10%; margin-left: 10%; text-align: justify;">
            The main work was a presentation on one of the seven themes of social psychology in groups of two. These presentations were the only theoretical material we had during the class, so we had to include all the key elements while also presenting something fun and interesting. I decided to present the subject of Intercultural Relationships with a Kahoot in the end to present some fun facts. You can find the presentation in the following link:

            This class also used new teaching methods. It was composed of four tutorials, each of them beginning by a small lecture followed by work on the theme of the lecture. We had to choose an object and try to innovate it by following the TRIZ creativity method. With my team partner, we chose to study the chair. You can find our report in the link below:

            Instead of doing the sport internship because of medical issue, I had to write a report about the remarks the general opinions of the participants. I created a poll to ask the students questions about their expectations, their integration to the group, the progress of the internship, their global feelings and the possible improvements.

        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            The Innovation class started with a few theoretical lectures, talking about the main concepts of innovation, project management and teamwork. The real challenge started after these, when the class started to get really close with our main project. What we had to do was to rethink our project development and strategy taking into accounts the elements we had seen. When tasked with a project, most of us jump directly to a technical solution, without paying much attention to market, user acceptability or ethics constraints. We were encouraged and took time to write reports about specific issues from the class, and in the end, we had to present the takeaways from these with our project. We did a project presentation including the advancement at the beginning of December, risk assessment issues, our time management methods and social acceptability analysis.

        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            This class consisted in tutorials where we learn the concepts of the TRIZ method, and then we apply them to a study object of our choice. However, since it is a complex method, applying it correctly was not easy. The object I chose to study is the chair. We were asked to select a simple object, because using TRIZ on a complex object is really complicated. First, we conducted spatial and temporal analysis of the object. Then, we applied it to use the TRIZ resolution matrix.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            Applying the method gave us leads that we could apply to find concrete idea on how to improve the chair. In the end, the solution we proposed was to have a levitating chair, so the chair can be moved on every surface while staying as light as possible.

            The main challenge of this class was to prepare the presentation about Intercultural Relationships. We had to make the presentation fun, so it took a little time to find original ways of presentation. We settled for a Kahoot to introduce some fun intercultural facts.

        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            This class was composed of classical lectures about team management. The evaluation method was a case-study. That was the main challenge of this course. We had to shift our way of thinking regarding a team project because we had the perspective of a manager. This case-study asked us to deal with conflict, to motivate a team and to ensure good productivity and performance. Studying the theoretical notions is important but applying them to real-life examples helped me a lot to get comfortable with them.

        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            This class was not new to me since I took it since the first year at INSA Toulouse. Over the years, the teaching methods varied quite a lot. This year, the challenge was to be prepared for job interviews since we were looking for our end-of-studies internship. To do that, mockup interviews were organized. I did mine with a Human Resources manager at Celad. I was interviewed for a real job offer, posted by another company. It lasted 30 minutes and overall, I was quite happy with my performance. My interviewer gave me a lot of critical feedback, and it helped me to be more prepared for the actual job interviews I had later during the semester.

        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            I think that it is harder to specify the skills acquired in non-technical classes. 
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            For the Manage an Innovative project skillset, I think that I obtained these skills thanks to all the projects I was part of during my entire education at INSA Toulouse. They helped me to try to innovate in each of them and taught me how to solve a problem. Having a leading position in some of them was also a benefit to learn these skills.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            For the Learning teamwork skill, I can say probably the same. All the projects, and more importantly those of this year, working with students from different backgrounds, contributed to acquire the skill.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            For the Be convincing skillset, they were all acquired thanks to all the oral presentations we made this semester but also during all the years at INSA Toulouse. I often thought that there were too much of them, but I can see the results anyway. It gave me much more confidence in presenting my projects and ideas to a public.

        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            Every year at INSA, we have a Human Science module and I think that this year’s module was one of the best. I learned a lot of skills and knowledge about notions useful not only in an engineering context but also in our everyday life. I just wish I had more of this kind of classes before, classes that teach us notions about what it is like to work in a company like we had in Team Management. This class approaches a lot of concepts like trial period or how to read your payroll. I think that seeing all of that really reassure me about my future. The time scheduling was also very on point with this module.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            I liked the Creativity class as well because it was something that I have never seen before and the teaching method was truly nice and interesting. Trying to apply the TRIZ method on a simple object was a perfect way for me to understand the principles of this method. 
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            These classes, even if they do not teach us technical skills, are very important for our career but also for our personal growth. They give us the tools to guide ourselves as engineers and as humans. It is even more important at this time as we start a new stage of our life.
