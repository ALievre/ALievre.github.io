SUPERVIZOR: HÉLÈNE HERENG

<p style="text-indent: 2%; text-align: justify;">
    Being an engineer is about technical expertise, but we cannot neglect the human aspects of the profession. In this course, we will see different subjects that are relevent to engineers and humans of today. We will study management methods, but also creativity psychology techniques, along with sports mentality.

    <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
        The Innovation & Humanity module gathers the six classes that don't focus on technical skills but rather management, creativity and human skills. We will study management, social psychology, innovation and creativity and even sports practise. We will also have a professsional development class with a mockup job interview. The variety of the classes makes so that some of the skills learned are directly linked to managing a project as an engineer, but other apply to humans in general and how to live as a citizen in our society.

        <p style="text-indent: 10%; margin-left: 10%; text-align: justify;">
            The social psychology class was certainly one of the more original classes of the year. Compared to other classes of the module where the learning process was classical, with the teacher passing on information to us, here different methods were preferred. We would often do debates on a subject where the teacher did not take part in it until the very end. We learned the core concepts through presentations by the students, and the only real instruction was to "not make it boring."
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10%; margin-left: 10%; text-align: justify;">
            We also spent an entire 3 hours class watching the movie Twelve Angry Men, and then analysing it. It is about a jury of men discussing if they should vote guilty or not guilty during a trial. Behind that, almost all the themes of social psychology like manipulation, social influence, prejudice were presented.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10%; margin-left: 10%; text-align: justify;">
          The main work we had to accomplish for the class was to present one of seven themes of social psychology. These presentations would be the only theoretical material we would have during the class, so we had to include all the key elements while also presenting something fun and interesting. I decided to present the subject of Stereotypes and Prejudice.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10%; margin-left: 10%; text-align: justify;">
            The main idea we had to make the presentation interactive and funny, was to play on the fact that one of the group members wars from Asian descent to have him expose stereotypes about himself. He began the presentation by just stating facts about his life, that were in fact all stereotypes. In the end, we conducted a debat on a subject that proved to be succesful. You can find the key slides of the presentation just below:

            The Innovation class started with a few theoretical lectures, talking about the main concepts of innovation, project management and teamwork. The real challenge started after these, when the class started to get really close with our main project. What we had to do was to rethink our project development and strategy taking into accounts the elements we had seen. When tasked with a project, most of us jump directly to a technical solution, without paying much attention to market, user acceptability or ethics constraints. We were encouraged and took time to write reports about specific issues from the class, and in the end, we had to present the taweaways from these with our project.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            We did a project presentation including the advancement at the beginning of december, risk assessment issues, our time management methods and social acceptability analysis. You can watch the slides of our presentation by clicking the link below.

        <summary style="color: #9c56c2">Creativity methods (TRIZ)</summary>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            The TRIZ class had a pretty simple premise. It consists in tutorials where we learn the key concepts of the TRIZ creativity method, and then we apply them to an study object of our choice. However, it is a pretty complex and powerful method, so aplying it correctly was not an easy task. The object I chose to study (in a group of two along with Diep Vu) is the Spoon. We were asked to select a simple object, because using TRIZ on a complex object is really complicated.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            What we did to understand the TRIZ method is the following:
        </p>
        <ul style="text-align: justify;">
            <li>First, we conducted some precise analysis of the object, by following some precise techniques which would give us key indicators about our object.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Then, we would use the analysis we made as a reading key to use the TRIZ resolution matrix. It is the main element of the method. How it works is you identify a contradiction in the object (for example you want the spoon to dissolve sugar faster but you don't want to put more effort in it), and then you put that contradiction in the matrix.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            Applying the method gave us solution leads that we could apply to find concrete idead on how to improve the spoon. In the end, one of the solutions we proposed was to have a heating spoon, that would melt sugar while you are stirring so it dissolves faster in coffee.

        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            The main technical challenge for this class was researching and preparing our presentation. Our theme was: Stereotypes and Prejudice. We had some key information to include so that people would at least get the key elements, but other than that we were pretty free to present how we wanted to.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            My main task was to present an unknown part of the notion of stereotype. After a lot of research, I decided to go with what is called The stereotype threat.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            It is a theory that tries to explain partly why stereotypes tend to confirm themselves, even though we are aware that they are stereotypes. I based my presentation partly of off the adjacent video. As it is done in it, I tried to explain very logically with a demonstration how stereotypes lead to prejudice then discrimination, which then comes back in a positive feedback loop to create a self-fullfiling prophecy. It means that being aware of being a victim of stereotype does not necessarily help you fight it.

        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            Team management was perhaps the most classical class of this module. It consisted in four lectures where we oversaw the main concepts of team management. It is the only class of this year that had an actual test, in the form of an MCQ (QCM in French). The technical challenge was to shift our way of thinking regarding working with a team on a project. Until now, we only have been equal members of a team, but pretty soon in our career, we will be in a project lead position and we will have to manage a team. Between dealing with conflicts, ensuring good productivity and performance and communicating your objectives to the team, even motivating people consistutes very important skills. The way we acquired them during the class was by doing a lot of exercises and case studies. Studying the theoretical notions is important, but applying them to real-life examples helped me a lot to get comfortable with them.

        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            The Individual Professional Development module (also called PPI) has been around every year since I got into INSA. Over the years, the teaching methods and form varied quite a lot, with standard lectures in first year, and small group discussions last year. In fifth year, the challenge was preparing us for a job interview simulation. As all of us were going to look for our fifth year internship, we needed to do well in interviews, and the teacher I had really tried to make us perform as well as we could. First, we talked a lot about techniques, good things to say and not say, subjects to put forward in an interview. However for these exercises, it is always good to practice as mush as possible. I practiced in front of a mirror, judging my non-verbal mistakes that are maybe more important than the things you may say.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            I did my mockup interview with the Human Resources manager at ACTIA. I was interviewing for a real job offer, posted by another company though. It lasted 30 minutes and overall I was quite happy with my performance. My interviewer gave me a lot of critical feedback, and I feel like it helped me a lot. I really felt more prepared for the actual job interviews I had later during the semester for my internship.

        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            It is harder to specify the skills acquired in non-technical classes, and I believe all of them are not present on the skills matrix.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            For the Manage an innovative project skillset, these are really important skills that are hard to master only from what we learn in class. I feel like my experience during my summer internship, and having a leading position in most of the student project I take part in, played a major role in my mastery of these skills.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            I would say most of the same applies to the Learning Teamwork project. I feel like the Team Management and social psychology classes are important to help learn this skill, but simply being with students coming from different background, cultures and countries also helped me a lot.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            As for the Be convincing: defend an idea point, to me it was acquired partly the very important number of oral presentations we made this semester. Sometimes, I think it is too much (it maybe is), but it sure helped me a lot with confidence when presenting my ideas to an audience. The different projects of the year also complemented what we learned in Innovation and Team Management classes.

        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            Overall, the Innovation and Humanity module was probably the Human Science module I like the most of my five years at INSA. My only gripe with it was that some classes felt rushed due to the limited number of hours allowed (especially the social psychology class), but I understand that every class is important and it is hard to find time in our already packed schedule.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            I feel like I learned a lot of skills and knowledge, and not necessarily things that only apply to an engineer. I really appreciate that we have classes that leave the frame of the computer science engineer and try to teach us elements that will be useful to us in our entire life.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            I felt really invested in the classes. Being at the beginning of the semester certainly helped a lot, giving us time to prepare and take time to research the classes, which we often don't have to do later in the semester. Keeping the Innovation module at the beginning is something I really appreciated and I hope it will remain that way in the future.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            Something that I also really like was that the Innovation class with Eric Jolivet shifted to be linked with the project more than he initially intended. Indeed, he gave us some of his class time to work on advancing our main project, because he realized we did not have any affected time to it in our schedule, and we were really falling behind. He had to skip some elements of his class to adjust to the lost time, but overall I feel like it was the right thing to do.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            Overall, these classes felt more important to me than they have ever been. They tried to give us guidance as engineers and as humans, as we are ready to enter a new stage of our life with the beginning of our professional career.
