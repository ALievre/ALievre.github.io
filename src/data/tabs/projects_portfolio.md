SUPERVIZOR: VINCENT MIGLIORE

<p style="text-indent: 2%; text-align: justify;">
    This semester is centered around a large-scale project. This project is a culmination of all the education we received at INSA. It brings together the skills and knowledge acquired during the semester. It puts us in the situation of leading and managing a project going over several months.

        This module gathers three classes. This is an important module because it includes the biggest project of the semester. We improved our English with this project since every deliverable must be in English. Moreover, the portfolio is the completion of the semester since it regroups every skills and knowledge we acquired during the semester.

            Everyone is used to standard GPS geopositioning in their car, in their phone or in their computer. Standard GPS receivers have an accuracy between 2 to 10 meters, and only in outdoor conditions. As a group of 5 students, we teamed up to answer a problem raised by our tutor, professor Guillaume Auriol: to geolocate meteorological balloons in association with a Paul Sabatier team led by Professor Hassan Sabbah. As you can guess, the standard GPS is not accurate enough to precisely locate the balloon. So, our tutor was interested in a Real-Time Kinetics (RTK) solution since its accuracy is far more precise. The launch of the ArduSimple starter kit LR offered a relatively low-cost RTK module. Therefore, the aim of our project is to assess this solution to see if it is compatible with the needs of the project. As you can in the picture below, we were in possession of an ArduSimple starter kit LR composed of:

            <li>2 simpleRTK2B boards (Rover and Base Station)</li>

            The entire ISS program is provided in english, most of the classes being taught in english along with all presentations we had to make. It is an important part of the entire year, but it was mostly linked with the innovative project. To that end, the main challenge this year linked to english was the realization of a website to promote our product: Alison. I was in charge of developing the website, so it was a software challenge for me. I believe starting with the Alison website both last year and this year is what made me consider building my portfolio as a website as well.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            Concerning the english of the website, the main difficulty was writing in a style that corresponds well to startups and young projects. The idea was not simply to write correct english, we also had to be enciting in our communication to generate interest around the project.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            We also had a lot of work for the different presentations of the project we made throughout the year. While we have practised our presentation skills for five years, there are still many ways that we can improve, especially in english. After presenting the final product at the end of the semester, I really felt like I had made progress on my presentation skills in english, having a better energy and fluidity in my speech.

            Similarly to the website I had to develop for our Innovative project, the main technical challenge of this portoflio is the form I decided to give it. The main challenge of course is writing the content of the portfolio, but this will be the focus of the analytical part. I chose to build a website to have a really flexible portfolio, where one could navigate clearly and easily between all the pieces that are put together. There is a lot of content in this portfolio and I did not want to stull 80% of the content in an appendix part at the end where no one would read it. I wanted everything to be readily available, and I am confident that I succeeded with this objective.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
           The website was realized using bootstrap 4 and a bootstrap 4 theme called Paper Kit 2. While the use of a theme certainly helped with the initial design of the website, I truly believe that the changes I made to it and the decisions I made in the layout and choice of content to include really improved my web design skills. It is a domain that is not really taught at INSA (understandably so because it is not always an engineer's job) but I personally really enjoy it, so I really appreciated the opportunity to improve thanks to the portfolio.

        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            None of the skills present in this module are technical skills. Even though being an engineer in compmuter science is a mainly technical jobs, I feel like the skills I acquired in this module are some of the most important of the year.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            I really invested myself into the Innovative Project, because it is a project that I was personally involved in from last year and I really like working on it. This year, I had more of a manager role, dealing with coordinating the different skillsets and tasks at hand. I feel that I really improved on my presentation and communication skills, and that my enthusiasm for this project was received by others. We were able to go from a technological proof of concept of sound recognition with NMF, to a fully packaged product with a real client experience that worked great as a demonstration. The project is still open and we may have a partnership with Toulouse city-hall to continue it moving forward. In the end, the innovative project is probably what I am the most proud of for this year.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            Speaking of things I am really proud of, the portfolio is probably close second behind the project. I have been frustrated this year because I felt that we had too little time to really invest in the different deliverables we had to produce, so I knew I wanted to spend time on the portfolio to make it as good as I could. I started really late, having only a rough draft at the end of December. However, I knew since the end of November that I wanted to invest all my time during the christmas break in it. I made sure that I ended all my other assignments to have only the portfolio to work on.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            I tried to work on the form to have something as easy and pleasant to read as possible, but also on the actual content that remains the most important part of the exercise. I made the choice to only present experiences made during the 5ISS program, not including my 4th year internship (even though the poster is viewable in the generalities section) or skills coming from out of INSA, like the ones acquired during my time in the Enfoiros for example.
            To me, this was a really dense formation and I have learned way enough things to fill this portfolio with.

        <summary style="color: #42a5f5">General review and feedback on the course</summary>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            For this module, I decided not to make a specific module review but rather try to think about the year in general. The Innovative project really encapsulates the biggest part of the year for me, and it was not really relevent to talk about it without the rest.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            I am writing this conclusion after participating in the general review of ISS between students and the teachers. I don't think that I truly understood the philosophy of ISS until that point. What it aims to be is a series of modules, with mainly lectures and laboratories, designed to help us and give us skills in our Innovative project. The way I experienced it, it was more many courses and modules with their own projects and deliverables, and then a big project that had no real connection to them. This is probably due to the fact that our project comes from our initiative, so the scientific content in it does not directly relate to what we see in 5ISS.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
           However, this does not mean that I was not satisfied with the teaching of the year. There were some really good and interesting modules, expecially Smart Devices. To me, it really encapsulates the spirit of ISS as I see it. All the classes in the module flow well together, there are dedicated requirements for every background, and you build a real tangible thing in the end that you can be proud of.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            The bet of proposing such an innovative teaching for every module is of course really hard to put in place, however I wish that more modules would reach the same level of flexibility as this one, and I believe that each year will improve the quality of the formation.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            Coming from a background in computer science, I was a little bit scared when I decided to join ISS. I was afraid that I would not be able to follow certain classes, notably in networking or physics. However, I feel like the focus was not on reaching expert levels in technical skills from other domains, but rather know how to make these domains work together in projects, and integrate everything. I think the most important skill that I learned this year was how to manage and work on a project involving problematics that don't have anything to do with each other on a technical level, but are all as important and depend on each other. It may be due to our project, who add a much bigger focus on product design and communication compared to the rest, but I really understand the Innovative part in the name of the cursus.
        </P>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            The human sciences classes, and especially the Innovation and Psychology classes were some of my favorites of the year, allowing us to explore domains that were completely out of the technical, software oriented flavor of the rest of the year. One of the gripe I could raise is that most of the modules (except Smart Devices) were really tailored towards computer science students, so while it was pretty easy to follow them, I did not have the chance to improve my technical skills in most of them.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            However, I feel like with how dense the year is in terms of deliverables and deadlines, feeling competent and able to solve most of the technical problems that I faced quickly was a real asset in helping me stay organized and on top of things.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            I steel feel like I had to rush some assignments, notably in the Communication module taking place at the end of the year. It saddens me because it is one of the domains where I am the least at ease in, but unfortunately between all the other projects I did not fin time to invest myself in it as much as I would hacve wanted.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            In the end, I feel like if I had to choose which orientation to take f or my fifth year today, I would still decide to go with ISS with almost no hesitation. There were some clear issues with deliverables and timetables, but those are all minors compared to what the formation offered me. Having no exams and working on so many different topics and projects was really intense, but also really satisfying in the end. The end of the year was a real rush, especially for our Innovative project, but I am really happy with how it all came out in the end.
