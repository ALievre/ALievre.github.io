<h3 style="color: #9599a0">Communication</h3>

SUPERVIZOR: DANIELA DRAGOMIRESCU

<p style="text-indent: 2%; text-align: justify;">
    Communication protocols are one of the bases of connected objects. Innovation happens with new standards appearing everyday like 5G. It is important for us to be aware of the main technologies used today. In this course, we studied protocols (LoRa, Zigbee, Sigfox, NB-IoT, ...) but also energy problematics, wireless radio methods and security.

    <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
        The communication module gathers five classes This module is very dense since it deals with a lot of subjects all centered around the Internet of Things. IoT have many problematics: battery, wireless communication, or security. These problematics are studied in the classes of this module. We have the full picture of communication for IoT. You can find a quick summary of the courses content in the adjacent table. The next subsection will focus on one of the most relevant experiences: the Software Defined Radio (SDR) labs.

        <p style="text-indent: 10%; margin-left: 10%; text-align: justify;">
            The main experience I retained from this module is the series of labs that focused on Software Defined Radios (abbreviated SDR). SDR are used to replace hardware component for frequency shift, demodulation, and other operations to receive FM signal. A single device process all these tasks and the signal is decoded through software.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10%; margin-left: 10%; text-align: justify;">
            During three labs, we learned the theory behind decoding a FM signal. Then, we used GNUradio to manipulate a radio signal. The goal was to try to get the audio from a recorded radio signal. To do so, we used different treatment elements like frequency shifters, band-pass filters, frequency demodulators, and more. The signal treatment is done entirely with the software. The software is easy to use since you have blocks that you have to link together with the correct parameters. After different treatment steps, we were able to decode the signal and thus, to retrieve a clean audio signal. I think it was a clever way of doing the lab because it was exciting to try to decode the signal and very rewarding to have the result and to listen to the audio.

     <p style="text-indent: 10%; margin-left: 10%; text-align: justify;">
            The main challenge of this module was the number of deliverables and assignments we had to produce.

        <summary style="color: #9599a0">Protocols for connected objects</summary>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            In groups of three, we had to present different protocols for Wireless Sensor Network, e.g., LoRA, Sigfox, BLE, ZigBee, NB-IoT or M2M. My group chose to study NB-IoT. It was difficult to find information about the protocol we chose. Certain characteristics were easy to understand thanks to online documentation. However, when we had to find precise information e.g., value of the radio range in a real environment, we ended up doing a lot of unsuccessful research.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
           This assignment was also challenging for me because I am not really at ease with communication and networking. Thankfully, since I was not alone to do this, I was able to understand a little bit more thanks to my teammates. Watching the presentation of other protocols also helped me understand the one I was working on a bit more, as there are a lot of similarities between the different protocols. We also conducted a deep study of the MAC layer options for IoT. This assignment was challenging for me as well. Thankfully, there are a lot of resources online that helped me understand the different concepts.

            In this class, we learned how Software Defined Networks (SDN) worked. We participated in labs to manipulate them. The SDN technology we used was OpenFlow switches. This technology uses a networking application which dynamically and automatically writes rules in switching routing tables. These rules are written depending on the topology of the network, its current state, and the traffic. The challenge was to understand the concept and implement it on a network.

        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            For this course, we had to present a topic about 5G in teams of two. With my partner, we chose “5G and smart cities”. We found a lot of information online, but the main challenge was to select the right data. We also did not know how technical the presentation had to be.

        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            In this class, we had different lab session: one lab session about electromagnetic energy harvesting and wireless power transfer and two lab sessions at the AIME. During the first one, the main challenge was the equipment. In fact, we could not finish the rectifier characterization since the rectifiers were not working. We finished the session by watching the professor do the manipulations because of faulty equipment.

            The deliverable for this course was a security assessment for our Innovative project. The main challenge was to study a countermeasure with ProVerif. Implementing the code was difficult because we were not acquainted with this method.

        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            As I said in the Technical Challenge section, the module was vast and dense. The number of classes gave us a lot of information and assignments at the same time. As you can see in the skill matrix, the first section is heavily loaded. This represents the amount of work and skills required in a few weeks.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            For the Communication Protocols course, I do not feel that I reached the expected level. I think I did not have enough time to study this class. I felt overwhelmed by the amount of information we were given. This module was clearly not my strength. I still think that I understand the general overview of IoT standards, but I am not really at ease with more technical skills concerning the energy or complex reception process. I think that a lot of students were in a similar situation. We exchanged a lot to try to understand the main concepts of this class.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            For the Emerging Networks class, I think that the labs really helped me acquire the skills I needed to reach the expected level. I could manipulate the technology which is my favorite way of learning. I can say the same for the Energy for IoT class.

        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            This module was very vast. We tried to overview a lot of notions in a few weeks and workload was heavy. I feel that I had not enough time to fully understand the concepts and technologies presented to me. The teaching method through student presentations was good because it offers an interesting point of view on the technologies, but it was also not very optimal because we were unsure about the information given.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            I think it is too bad to have the AIME labs of Energy for IoT on the last week even though I know that the time schedule is tight in ISS. Also, we could have been more prepared for the first lab of Energy if we had a tutorial session before to go over the theoretical part. Moreover, I think that it would be great to have tutorials or labs for the Security for IoT class to have a better understanding of the notions covered.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            Regardless of all that, I enjoyed this module. It deconstructs the IoT into different categories to try to give us a clear and pretty exhaustive picture of the state of Internet of Thing today. It gave me a certain understanding of IoT that I did not have before. IoT was not the main reason I chose ISS but I know now that this area has a lot of fascinating possibilities for the future.
