        <p style="text-indent: 10%; margin-left: 10%; text-align: justify;">
            1)	Read the documentation to understand what was expected of my work <br>
            2)	Familiarization with the CANoe software <br>
            3) Normalization of the code <br>
            Why CANoe ? This software can emulate the sensor's interface on a vehicule. It makes it possible to develop, test and analyze individual ECU or a network of ECU. <br>
            4)  Creation of panel to test the NFC. They needed this panel to test the NFC protocol quickly without having to modify the code each time <br>
            NFC : NFC ou Near-Field Communication is a proximity-based wireless communication standard. <br>
            5)  Upgrade the routine control SFD UDS panel <br>
            SFD :  SFD, Security Fahrzeug Diagnosis, means Vehicule Diagnosis Protection. It is the procedure recovering a certified token in order to use UDS services. <br>
            UDS : UDS ou Unified Diagnostic Services is a communication protocol used for ECU diagnosis, debugging and configuration. <br>
