## Introduction

<p style="text-indent: 2%; text-align: justify;">
In this portfolio, you will find all the courses I took during my 5th year at INSA Toulouse. From October 2021 to January 2022, I took the Innovative Smart Systems (ISS) Transverse Multidisciplinary Project (PTP). I attended 8 semesters (4 years) of general engineering training composed of:
</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
    <li>2 semesters of common program</li>
    <li>3 semesters of pre-specilization in Material Devices and Systems Engineering</li>
    <li>1 semester of specialization in Automatic Control and Electronics</li>
    <li>2 semesters of specialization in Automatic Control and Electronics, in the Embedded Systems section</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-indent: 2%; text-align: justify;">
After these 3 years, the last semester in this PTP was really unusual because it brought together people with different background (electronics, computer science, physics, business and management). It was an amazing opportunity to learn from them and to try to gather as many hard and soft skills as I could.
